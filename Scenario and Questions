# THE SITUATION
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner 
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he 
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer 
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions. 

# Question 1
My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. Please send over 
the managersâ€™ names at each store, with the full address of each property (street address, district, city, and 
country please).
